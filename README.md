🌦️ Weather Data Analysis Dashboard
An interactive web-based dashboard built using Flask, Python, Pandas, and Plotly, designed to visualize temperature and rainfall trends using historical weather data.

📖 Project Overview
This project analyzes daily weather data (Temperature & Rainfall) and provides meaningful visual insights through an interactive dashboard.
Users can filter the data by year and month, view summary statistics, and explore multiple graphs to understand weather patterns, climate behavior, and relationships between variables.

This dashboard helps in studying:
Seasonal variations
Monthly climate behavior
Temperature patterns
Rainfall distribution
Correlation between weather attributes

🚀 Features
🔍 Interactive Filters
Filter data by Year
Filter data by Month
Dashboard updates instantly based on selection

📊 Data Analysis & Visualizations
Average Temperature Trend
Rainfall Trend Over Time

🧹 Data Preprocessing
The dataset is cleaned using Pandas:
Converted date format (dayfirst=True)
Converted Temp Max, Temp Min, and Rain columns to numeric
Removed invalid rows
Calculated new feature: Average Temperature
Added Year and Month columns for filtering

🎯 Purpose of the Project
This project helps students, researchers, and weather analysts to:
Understand climate data trends
Observe how temperature and rainfall vary seasonally
Compare monthly climate behavior
Study rainfall–temperature relationships
Easily explore weather data using a user-friendly dashboard
